# Daniel Stephenson

I am a curious, analytical and ambitious person, looking for a role where I can put everything I've learned about code into practice while gaining exposure to business strategy.

Since graduating from Sheffield Hallam University with a 2:1 in History, I've worked as a door-to-door salesman, an English Teacher in both Vietnam and China and in an Operations role in a FinTech bank. It was in the latter where I witnessed how a few lines of code can challenge a centuries-old banking industry, so I've done everything possible to learn the invaluable skill of coding for myself.

#### Learner
I have a drive and ability to continuously learn and an intuition to know how I learn best. After spending a week learning Ruby on Rails, I used the weekend to put this knowledge into practice, dedicating my entire Saturday to filling in the learning gaps in my knowledge, especially when it came to using continuous integration services like Travis CI. This helped me test my code more robustly every time I wanted to commit a new build to GitHub. Consequently, I was able to create an app that mimicked the core functionalities of Instagram, by myself, in two days.

#### Solution-Focused
I have a creative solution-orientated approach to problem-solving, which involves critically analysing situations, identifying potential shortcomings and making necessary adjustments. As part of my exchange semester at Vienna School for Business and Economics, I visited three local clients in their offices to listen to their needs and goals and engineer tailored strategy advice. Collaborating with a French colleague, we created innovative solutions to their needs and structured them in a digestible, ‘McKinsey-style’ PowerPoints that showed the evidence behind our conclusions. The clients were visibly impressed with our suggestions and gave us positive and constructive feedback. I haven’t been back to Vienna since, so I don’t know yet if they’ve acted on our advice!

#### Research
The ability to handle qualitative and quantitative data collection, analysis and interpretation. For my 14,000 word dissertation in my final year of my History undergraduate degree, I discovered that previously classified documents on the Falklands War had been made available to the public. I relished the chance to produce a piece of work using sources no-one had yet accessed! I made numerous trips to the National Archives, poring through documents and compiling evidence to support my thesis. This resulted in me obtaining a First Class Honours grade overall.

#### Adaptability
I have a proven ability to quickly adapt to different cultures and countries, having already lived in China, Vietnam and Austria. I moved to China in 2015, working as an English Teacher with classes of over 60 students, aged between 7 and 12. To keep my lessons fun, interesting and engaging, I constructed lesson plans to help the students exercise their English skills while learning more about myself and the UK. As a consequence, their English skills showed a remarkable improvement and, when I left, they wrote me cards in perfect English, telling me how much they’d enjoyed my lessons with them.
