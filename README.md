# Daniel Stephenson

I am a curious, analytical and ambitious person, looking for a role where I can put everything I've learned about code into practice while gaining exposure to business strategy.

Since graduating from Sheffield Hallam University with a 2:1 in History, I've worked as a door-to-door salesman, an English Teacher in both Vietnam and China and in an Operations role in a FinTech bank. It was in the latter where I witnessed how a few lines of code can challenge a centuries-old banking industry, so I've done everything possible to learn the invaluable skill of coding for myself.

## <a name="skills"></a>Skills

#### Learner
I have a drive and ability to continuously learn and an intuition to know how I learn best. I have a track record of this at Makers Academy, where I went from knowing very little about programming to developing my own web application in a few weeks. The challenge was to learn about using Ruby on Rails independently, and then to put what we'd learned into practice when we worked solo at the weekend. I dedicated my entire Saturday to filling in the learning gaps in my knowledge, especially when it came to using continuous integration services like Travis CI. This helped me test my code more robustly every time I wanted to commit a new build to GitHub. Consequently, I was able to add more skills to my repertoire, making myself a more rounded developer and the result was that I created an app that mimicked the core functionalities of Instagram, by myself, in two days.

#### Solution-Focused
I have a mindset of bringing a creative solution-orientated approach to solve daily problems by critically analysing situations, identify potential shortcomings and make necessary adjustments. As part of my exchange semester at Vienna School for Business and Economics, we were required to practice our problem-solving skills as part of a course module. Our goal was to visit three local clients in their offices, listen to their needs and goals, and engineer tailored strategy advice through structured PowerPoint presentations. Collaborating with a French colleague, we created innovative solutions to our clients' needs and structured them in an easy-to-understand, 'McKinsey-style' PowerPoint presentation that showed the evidence behind our conclusions. The clients were visibly impressed with our suggestions and gave us positive and constructive feedback. I haven't been back to Vienna since, so I don't know yet if they've acted on our advice!
#### Research
The ability to handle qualitative and quantitative data collection, analysis and interpretation. I studied History for my undergraduate degree, so my final year project was to write a 14,000 word dissertation on a topic of my choice. Through independent research, I discovered that previously classified documents on the Falklands War had been made available to the public, so I relished the chance to produce a piece of work using sources no-one had access to yet! I made numerous trips to the National Archives in West London, poring through documents and compiling evidence to support my thesis, gradually building it piece-by-piece throughout the year. This resulted in me obtaining a First Class Honours grade overall.

#### Adaptability
I have a track record in adapting to unfamiliar surroundings in different cultures and countries. I've already lived in China, Vietnam and Austria. I moved to China in late 2015, working as a Foreign English Teacher. I was curious about that part of the world, so I thought I'd go and see it for myself. My responsibilities were to teach classes of over 60 students, aged between 7 and 12 and help them improve their English grammar, pronunciation and fluency. To keep my lessons fun, interesting and engaging, I constructed lesson plans that helped the students exercise their English skills while learning more about myself and the UK. It turned out that they were just as unfamiliar with Britain as I was with China! As a consequence, they kids' English skills showed a remarkable improvement and when I left, they  wrote me cards in perfect English, telling me how much they'd enjoyed my lessons with them.
