# Daniel Stephenson

I am a curious, analytical and ambitious person, looking for a role where I can put everything I've learned about code into practice while gaining exposure to business strategy.

Since graduating from Sheffield Hallam University with a 2:1 in History, I've worked as a door-to-door salesman, an English Teacher in both Vietnam and China and in an Operations role in a FinTech bank. It was in the latter where I witnessed how a few lines of code can challenge a centuries-old banking industry, so I've done everything possible to learn the invaluable skill of coding for myself.

## Skills

#### Analytical
- I can critically evaluate and review information and logically analyse facts and data. I developed these skills during two degrees, where I attained a first class honours in my undergraduate dissertation and a distinction in my Master's Degree.
#### Learner
- Every day not learning and not adding to your own personal market value is a day spent stagnating. I have a drive and ability to continuously learn and intuition to know how I learn best.
#### Research
- The ability to handle qualitative and quantitative data collection, analysis and interpretation. A skill honed over two degrees.
#### Cultural Awareness
- Highly experienced in displaying cultural sensitivity when working with international colleagues. I've gained experience in working in culturally diverse teams during my MSc and my time in China.
#### Adaptability
- I have a track record in adapting to unfamiliar surroundings in different cultures and countries. I've lived in China, Vietnam and Austria already and I'm hoping there'll be more to come!
#### Solution-Focused
- I have a mindset of bringing a creative solution-orientated approach to solve daily problems by critically analysing situations, identify potential shortcomings and make necessary adjustments. I have exercised this skill during consulting projects in Vienna and in Manchester.
#### Consultancy
- I provided consulting solutions for three Austrian companies in the form of structured, clear PowerPoint presentations.
#### Indivualisation
- The ability to notice and appreciate the unique characteristics of each person and customise my approach accordingly.
